- Vite for development and build optimization

## 3. Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### 3.1 Cloud Service Models

This project utilizes multiple cloud service models:

**Software as a Service (SaaS):**
Supabase is used as a SaaS solution that provides authentication and database services without requiring management of the underlying infrastructure. This allows the development team to focus on application features rather than database administration.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
AWS Amplify serves as a PaaS solution for hosting the web application. It provides a platform for deploying and managing the application without concern for the underlying infrastructure, while offering integrated CI/CD capabilities.

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
Amazon EC2 and S3 are used as IaaS components, providing compute and storage resources that can be configured according to application needs. These services offer greater control over the environment while abstracting hardware management.

### 3.2 Cloud Deployment Models

The application implements a hybrid cloud deployment model:

**Public Cloud:**
The primary infrastructure resides in AWS's public cloud, leveraging its global availability, scalability, and extensive service offerings.

**Private Components:**
Certain sensitive operations, such as trade data calculations and analysis, are contained within the application's frontend code, creating a form of private cloud processing that occurs on the user's device.

This hybrid approach balances the need for accessibility, scalability, and data privacy.

### 3.3 Key Cloud Characteristics

The implementation demonstrates the five essential characteristics of cloud computing:

**On-demand Self-service:**
Users can provision application resources without requiring human interaction with service providers. The architecture allows for automatic scaling based on demand.

**Broad Network Access:**
The application is accessible via standard mechanisms (web browsers and mobile apps) promoting use by heterogeneous client platforms.

**Resource Pooling:**
AWS's multi-tenant model pools resources to serve multiple consumers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned according to demand.

**Rapid Elasticity:**
The application can quickly scale outward or inward based on demand. Database connections and compute resources can expand automatically during peak usage periods.

**Measured Service:**
Cloud resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

## 4. Application Architecture

   - Database operations executed and results returned
   - Frontend updates UI based on response

3. **Analytics Processing Flow:**
   - User requests analytics on their trading performance
   - Secured API retrieves relevant trade data
   - Data processing for analytics occurs in frontend application
   - Visualization components render charts and insights

## 5. Cloud Infrastructure Implementation

### 5.1 Selected Cloud Provider: AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) was selected as the primary cloud provider for this project based on several factors:

1. **Comprehensive Service Offering:** AWS provides all necessary services for hosting web and mobile applications, from compute and storage to database and authentication.
